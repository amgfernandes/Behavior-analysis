Trying out clustering: Looming competition data (Equal stimuli)


# Can we use clustering to find meaningful insights when zebrafish are faced with two competing threatening stimuli?
See Notebook inside the folder Unsupervised_clustering for analysis.

Answer: No. This approach does not reveal distinct response types. Clustering is NOT a good approach for this behavioral data. I have tried several different clustering algorithms but none seems to lead to good results regarding findind meaningful response types. Boundaries seem arbitrary.

See folder WTA_vs_Averaging_modeling for the approach used to address this question
