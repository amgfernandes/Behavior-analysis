# This notebook loads the raw behavioral data and processes the data for further analysis (exported csv files can be used for rest of the project). 
The raw data file is big and therefore not provided here. 

Some of the helper functions for preprocessing the data were written with the help of Johannes Larsch (https://github.com/jlarsch).
