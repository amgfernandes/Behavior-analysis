Behavior analysis of zebrafish decision making

# This repository shows the approaches used to try to understand how zebrafish respond to competing stimuli.

I tried Clustering (see folder Clustering) but that approach did not lead to meaningful conclusions.

Based on these results I decided to use a modeling approach that is based on two famous models for decision-making: Averaging and WTA.

This approach was successful and I allowed making predictions for the behavioral outcome when animals are confronted with two competing stimuli (in this case two aversive stimuli, looming)


Be carefull when you decide right or left! :)

The modeling approach under the folder WTA_vs_Averaging_modeling was performed with great help of Joe Donovan (https://github.com/joe311). 

Some of the helper functions for preprocessing the data (see Preprocessing behavioral data folder) were written with the help of Johannes Larsch (https://github.com/jlarsch).
